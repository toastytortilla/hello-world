This is my first edit in this respoitory's first branch
My name is Daniel and I'm looking into a career change. 
I think that it would be a wise decision to move into the tech world for many reasons...
I enjoy it first and foremost, and it can be lucrative. 
The creative nature of tech is appealing and rewarding, 
and I love thinking of ways to solve my problems.
